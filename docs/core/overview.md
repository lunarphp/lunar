# Welcome to Lunar!

::: danger Alpha Release
Version 1.x is currently in alpha release. We recommend this version for new projects, however, it is not 
feature-complete and therefore may not be deemed production-ready.
:::

We are delighted you are considering Lunar for your project. We've spent a lot of time developing this package to bring headless e-commerce functionality to Laravel.

## What is Lunar?

Lunar is a [Laravel e-commerce package](https://lunarphp.io/) which brings functionality akin to Shopify and other e-commerce platforms to Laravel. You have complete freedom to create your own storefront(s), but we've already done the hard work for you in the backend.

## Tech Stack

Lunar is comprised of two packages; `lunarphp/core` which provides the e-commerce functionality and `lunarphp/admin` which provides an admin hub built upon Laravel Livewire.

Although the admin hub uses Laravel Livewire, there is no requirement for your app to use Livewire itself.

## What are the future plans?

Lunar as a company has grand plans to continue developing new functionality to help you build awesome e-commerce websites. We want Lunar to be a true alternative to the likes of Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.

## Get started

Enough waffle! Let's help you [install Lunar...](/core/installation)
