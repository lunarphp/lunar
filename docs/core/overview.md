# Welcome To Lunar!

We are delighted you are considering Lunar for your project. We've spent a lot of time developing this package to bring 
headless e-commerce functionality to Laravel.

## What Is Lunar?

Lunar is a [Laravel e-commerce package](https://lunarphp.io/) which brings functionality akin to Shopify and other 
e-commerce platforms to Laravel. You have complete freedom to create your own storefront(s), but we have already done 
the hard work for you in the backend.

## Tech Stack

Lunar is comprised of two packages; `lunarphp/core` which provides the e-commerce functionality and `lunarphp/admin` 
which provides an admin hub built upon Laravel Livewire.

Although the admin hub uses Laravel Livewire, there is no requirement for your app to use Livewire itself.

## What Are The Future Plans?

Lunar as a company has grand plans to continue developing new functionality to help you build awesome e-commerce 
websites. We want Lunar to be a true alternative to the likes of Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.

## Get Started

Enough waffle! Let's help you [install Lunar...](/core/installation)
